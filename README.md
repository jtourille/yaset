# YASET - Yet Another SEquence Tagger 

`yaset` is a sequence tagger written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). This tool can be used for various NLP-related sequence tagging tasks (e.g. [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) or [Part-of-Speech tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)). It implements state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for sequence tagging from the NLP community.
